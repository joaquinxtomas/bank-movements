# PDF/TXT to Excel (bank statements)

## Overview
I work in an accounting firm. I had to upload data from a bank statement (from a specific bank) to an Excel spreadsheet to make accounting entries. Normally, itÂ´s done one transaction at a time, but it was really tedious and time-consuming, so I created this script to automate it. 

* This script supports TXT file and PDF file from respective bank.

## Functions
* If it's a PDF, extract the necessary data using `pdfplumber`. Id it's a TXT file, the data is extracted natively.
* Maps transactions to specific Excel columns based on keywords.
* Inserts data only in the correct month sheet.
* Add rows if necessary and apply the corresponding borders to them.
* It does not allow duplicates to avoid errors or confusion.

## Requirements

You need `python 3.8+` and the libraries: 
* `openpyxl` (install)
* `pdfplumber` (install) 
* `glob` 
* `re` 
* `datetime` 
* `locale` 

## Usage
1. Place your PDF or TXT file in the same folder as the script. __ONLY ONE PDF OR TXT FILE IS ALLOWED AT THE SAME TIME__.
2. Place the Excel workbook where the transactions will be recorded in the same folder (have an specific format).
3. Run the script.

## Notes

#### This is a personal project with specific conditions. You can modify the data as you prefer, as this project reads a specific bank statement file and sends the data to an Excel file with a specific format. 

#### The PDF is read using coordinates. You can research how to modify this section to read the data you are looking for.
